<h1 class="header">Hi, I'm Yusuf from Turkey and i am 16.</h1>
<p class="pfont">I have interest to nothing 'cause i can't study on something. I'm just sitting on my computer desk all day.</p>
<p class="pfont">I don't know...</p>
<p class="pfont">I don't like Windows and I use Linux. I started to use linux with Xubuntu (lightweight ubuntu) and my laptop was broken after days. I wasn't have a computer for a long time. When my father buy me a desktop computer. I continued Ubuntu with my new pc. Someday when im looking in applications menu in Ubuntu GNOME it's stuck, then i don't like Ubuntu. I search for any distro. I found Arch Linux and install it with some internet guides for installing.Nowadays, i am still using Arch  Linux i and i love it so much. Pacman package manager is good and isn't like apt. I think pacman is better than apt. I can say Arch Linux is just for me :D.<br>
I'm a IT student, learning HTML and CSS in my School.<br>
